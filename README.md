## Background
In oceanography, a front is a boundary between two ocean masses. They can be distinguished by changes in parameters like Sea Surface Height (SSH), Temperature, Salinity, etc.

Jones et. al. 2018, is a notable paper where Principal Component Analysis and Gaussian Mixture Models were used on Argo float data in order to detect fronts in the Southern Ocean. 

Our attempt is to use BGC-Argo float data, which measures biogeochemical parameters like Chlorophyll, Dissolved Oxygen, Downwelling Irradiance, etc., in order to generate similar front boundaries in the Southern Ocean.
